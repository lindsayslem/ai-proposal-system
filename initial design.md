# Initial Project Design
## Project Purpose
The purpose of my project is to create an AI-powered web app that help contractors generate, edit, and send proposals using real pricing data. The goal of the project is to automate
proposal writing, keep all job information in one place, allow users to edit and export proposals, and track proposal status in one log.
