Summarize in words and pictures what your project purpose and goals are (other students will see this as well and it will help them quickly grasp the purpose of you project).
The purpose of my project is to create an AI-powered web app that help contractors generate, edit, and send proposals using real pricing data. The goal of the project is to automate
proposal writing, keep all job information in one place, allow users to edit and export proposals, and track proposal status in one log. 

Sketch your initial thinking on your ERD and the data your project will be accessing and using
Sketch rough system design of your project, what are the technologies and pieces (shapes) and interactions (arrows)
Make initial goals for where you want your project to be at each day until the end of class.

Please include any additional relevant information you'd like to include or have. If you project has UX maybe you could have some rough sketch of that as well.
